**Summary:**

An individual claiming to represent the Three River's electric company initiated a conversation with an account holder (John Doe) requesting personal identifying information for a bi-annual security check.

* The request for the account holder's SSN is not typically part of a security check for utility companies.

* The anonymity of the individual claiming to be from the electric company and the lack of additional information (e.g., IP address) may hinder further investigation.
